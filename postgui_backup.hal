# Include your customized HAL commands here
# The commands in this file are run after the AXIS GUI (including PyVCP panel) starts

# **** Setup of spindle speed display using pyvcp -START ****
# **** Use COMMANDED spindle velocity from EMC because no spindle encoder was specified
# **** COMANDED velocity is signed so we use absolute component (abs.0) to remove sign

net spindle-cmd => abs.0.in
net absolute-spindle-vel <= abs.0.out => pyvcp.spindle-speed
